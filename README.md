# TrainScheduler
::bullettrain_side:
### A train scheduler that incorporates Firebase and Moment.js for arrival and departure data.

**What the project does:**
This project is excellent for web developers to extend their knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, the jQuery library, Bootstrap, Google's Firebase database, and Moment.js.

**Why the project is useful:**
TrainScheduler is lightweight, client-side, and written in JavaScript using the jQuery and Moment.js libraries. It is useful for understanding how JavaScript-generated content can be created and for learning how to use a Firebase database. Additionally, it is good for understanding the ISO 8601 24-hour international time standard.

**How users can get started with the project:**
Clone and extend the project with a different user interface or add additional features such as updating minutes to arrival and next train time each minute.

**Where users can get help with your project:**
One word here: "Google-fu." TrainScheduler is a common choice for budding web developers to practice being full stack web developers.

**Who maintains and contributes to the project:**
As of November 20, 1018 -- Wilder Molyneux, sole author and contributor.
